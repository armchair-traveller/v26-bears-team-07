## Our Project idea

[🎼 Bear Class](https://bearclass.netlify.app/) | Voyage-26 | https://chingu.io/ | Twitter: https://twitter.com/ChinguCollabs

We're creating a Google Classroom clone with the purpose of streamlining the process surrounding music teaching. It's going to be great! 😉

... Provided we can overcome these challenges...

## Features

- Good lord... I hope the answer falls out of the sky into my lap.
- Bears. Not geckos or toucans. Bears that can play music. 2 of them. And one other that's tone deaf.
- You know the drill... you can login. Create a class. Invite people. Get invited. All the stuff you ever dreamed of.

## Tech

Frontend: Svelte + Routify + urql

Database: FaunaDB (GraphQL frontend & FQL serverless functions)

Platform: Netlify

Media: TBD

Architecture: JAMstack (Serverless, so hot right now 🌶. Serverless)

## Our Goals

We used this project as an opportunity to take a deep dive into the world of Svelte.
